Young, single individuals may prefer to stay closer to areas with more nightlife, while families may gravitate to areas that have less nightlife but more parks and other outdoor recreation.  \n\nA recommendation engine assessing the various neighborhoods within a metropolitan area would assist potential movers with little-to-no familiarity with their future city in quickly locating neighborhoods that would be the most likely fit for them.  For this application, a set of personas with assumptions regarding their preferences will be formed, and the recommendations will be formed for the personas.  \n\nA recommendation engine like this could additionally be utilized by realtors in helping to identify key preferences and priorities of their clients, and identify neighborhoods in which they are more likely to buy.",

However, studies have shown that having too many options can result in analysis paralysis and frustration, and the number of potential venue categories within Foursquare is not small.  In order to prevent overwhelming potential users, we will keep the number of input options to a relatively small number by leveraging the hierarchical structure of the Venue Category List. Specifically, we will identify the top-level categories available in this hierarchy and compare neighbohoods using a combination of the top-level categories and preferences of our user personas to generate a recommendation.   \n\nThe top level categories include:\n- Arts & Entertainment\n- College & University\n- Event\n- Food\n- Nightlife Spot\n- Outdoors & Recreation\n- Professional & Other Places\n- Residence\n- Shop & Service\n- Travel & Transport\n",
